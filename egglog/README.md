# Elephant Elaborator with Egglog

* `elephant.egg` is the source file which defines the Elephant language and its elaboration rules.
* `test.egg` contains a small documented example using the Elephant rewrite rules.

## Egglog resources

* [Egglog](https://github.com/egraphs-good/egglog) is the language we use for defining the language and its rewrite rules.
* The [egglog web demo](https://egraphs-good.github.io/egglog/) is a handy resource for checking how to use different features of the egglog language.
